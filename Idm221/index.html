	<h3>Standard Bulk Road Salt and Enhanced Deicing Salt:</h3><br><br>
	<p>
		 
		Bulk Ice Control Salt, Road Salt, Highway Salt, Rock Salt and Sodium Chloride.

Our bulk road salt is the most efficient and cost effective way to eliminate snow and ice on roads, parking lots and other large surfaces. MAS deicing salt meets American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specification D632-12 and is treated with yellow prussiate of soda (YPS) as an anti-caking agent. <br>

Sweet Mix is an environmentally friendly blend of our bulk deicing salt and a 'sweet' liquid blending agent. Our blending process completely coats each salt crystal with liquid, increasing stickiness and reducing bounce and scatter.
